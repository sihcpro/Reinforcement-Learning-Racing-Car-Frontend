What is this?

This is frontend for my reinforcement-learning project that had been written by python
Back-end at: https://github.com/sihcpro/Reinforcement-Learning-Racing-Car-Backend


How to use this?

This is a simple front-end with a index.html file will call css and jquery
Remember to connect the internet so jquery could work normally.
